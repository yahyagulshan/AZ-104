## Manage Azure AD objects

- Create users and groups
- Manage licenses in Azure AD
- Create administrative units
- Manage user and group properties
- Manage device settings and device identity
- Perform bulk updates
- Manage guest accounts
- Configure self-service password reset


### Azure Active Directory

Azure AD is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud-based directory and IAM service. It supports user access to the following:
- Internal resources & apps located on the corporate network
- Cloud apps developed for the org
- External resources (M365, Azure portal, and other SaaS solutions)

Features of Azure AD:
- SSO
- SSPR
- MFA, conditional access policies, and group based access management.
- Cloud extensibility
- Ubiquitous device support: iOS, macOS, Windows, and Android devices work with Azure AD & share similar experiences.
- Admins can monitor risky sign-ins


### Azure AD Terms

Identity: an object that can be authenticated.
- A user with a username & password.
- Applications or other services that require authentication using certificates or private keys.

Account: an identity that has data associated with it.
- A valid identity is required to have an account.

Azure AD account: an identity created through Azure AD or M365.
- Identities are stored in Azure AD and are accessible to the org's cloud service subscriptions.
  - aka a work or school account
 
Azure tenant: a single, dedicated, and trusted instance of Azure AD.
- Each tenant, or directory, represents one organization.
    - When an org signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, a new tenant is created automatically.
- Multiple tenants can be created.

Azure subscription: used to pay for Azure services.
- Each subscription is connected to one tenant, but orgs can have multiple subscriptions.

Cloud identity: a user account with a cloud identity is defined only in Azure AD.
- These user accounts includes admin accounts & users who are managed. 
- A cloud identity can be for user accounts defined in the tenant and for user accounts defined in external Azure AD instances.
- When a cloud identity is removed from the main directory, the user account is deleted.

Directory-synchronized identity: user accounts that have a directory-synchronized identity are defined in an on-prem AD.
- Synchronizations occur using Azure AD Connect to bring the on-prem user accounts into Azure AD.
- Windows Server AD is the source of these user accounts.

Guest user: user accounts defined outside of Azure.
- User accounts from other cloud providers, and Microsoft accounts (Xbox).
- The source for guest users is Invited user.
- Guest user accounts are helpful when working with external vendors and contractors that need to gain access to your Azure resources.
  - Note: it's important to regularly review your org's guest user accounts.


### Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) compared to Azure AD

AD DS is the traditional deployment of a Windows Server-based AD on a physical, or virtual, server. It includes:
- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)
- Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)
- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
- Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS)

While Azure AD is similar to AD DS, there are many differences. It's different from deploying an AD Domain Controller (DC) on an Azure VM then adding to the on-prem domain.
- Identity solution: Azure AD is a **full identity solution** while AD DS is mainly a directory service.
  - Azure AD has features that support strong identity management and it was designed for apps that use HTTP/S communication.
- Federation services: Azure AD includes federation services and third-party services (Facebook)
- Flat structure: Users and groups in Azure AD are created in a flat structure.
  - There are no organizational units (OUs) or group policy objects (GPOs).
- Communication protocols: Azure AD doesn't use Kerberos authentication since it uses HTTP/S.
  - Azure AD uses protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication
  - Azure AD uses OAuth for authorization.
- Manage service: In Azure AD, you only manage users, groups, and policies.
  - Deploying AD DS with VMs using Azure, you're able to manage other tasks, including deployment, configuration, VMs, patching, and more.

### Azure AD SSPR

Self-service password reset (SSPR) allows users to have the ability to skip contacting the helpdesk and reset their passwords on their own.
- To enable SSPR, a global admin account is required.
  - Global admins are able to reset their own passwords, regardless of this setting being enabled for all users, selected or none.
      - Note: these are the only three options available for SSPR.
- SSPR uses a security group to limit users who have the privileges, if only some are enabled.
- All user accounts must have a license to use SSPR.
- At least one authentication method is required to reset a password.
  - To have a stronger plan, you should offer multiple methods for users to reset their passwords with.
  - Options include:
      - SMS
      - Email
      - Security code sent to a mobile or office phone
      - Security questions
  - Security questions can be required to registered by users in the tenant.
  - The number of correctly answered security questions required for a successful password reset can be configured.


### Manage licenses in Azure AD

View license plans & details
- Total: the total number of licenses purchased
- Assigned: the number of assigned licenses to users
- Available: the number of licenses thare are available to assign, including any that are about to expire
- Expiring soon: the number of licenses expiring soon

Assign licenses to a user or group
- User location must be specified before the license is assigned to a user
- If licenses are assigned from the user's license page, it can be directly assigned to a user

Remove or modify a license plan for users or groups
- On the licensed user / licensed group page, you can select the user or group that no longer has a license and click remove license
  - Note: licenses that a user inherits from a group **cannot** be removed directly


## Azure AD admin units

- Add admin units from the Azure portal
- Add details about users or groups in the unit
- Add assignments with relevant permissions per the admin unit
- Add IT members to assignments (roles)



### Manage device settings and device identity

Azure AD Registered Devices


Azure AD Joined Devices


Hybrid Azure AD Joined Devices



### Perform bulk updates

For bulk user creation, you can use the following:
- CSV
- Scripting

Requires Global admin or User admin.
- Note: from experience, this isn't always the case, but for the exam, remember that's what Microsoft states is "required" to complete bulk updates.



## Manage access control

- Create custom role-based access control (RBAC) and Azure AD roles
- Provide access to Azure resources by assigning roles at different scopes
- Interpret access assignments


### RBAC Scope

When granting access at the parent scope, the permissions are then inherited to the child scopes.

In Azure, we can specific scope at the following levels:
- Management Group (apply policies to multiple subscriptions within groups)
    - Subscription (manage billing)
        - Resource Group (lifecycle management tier for resources)
            - Resource


### Built-in RBAC Roles / Assignments

- Owner has full access to **all** resources and can delegate access to other users.
- Contributor can create and manage **all** types of Azure resources, but cannot grant access to other users.
- Reader is able to view Azure resources.
  - VM Reader can be used to target VMs specifically.
- User access administrator manages user access to Azure resources.
  - Reminder: this is an Azure AD role, unlike Owner, Contributor, and Reader.

Note: Custom roles can be created.





## Manage Azure subscriptions and governance

- Configure and manage Azure Policy
- Configure resource locks
- Apply and manage tags on resources
- Manage resource groups
- Manage subscriptions
- Manage costs by using alerts, budgets, and recommendations
- Configure management groups


### Manage subscriptions

An Azure subscription is a logical unit for setting up a resource boundary, environment boundary, and billing boundary. Each subscription has an account attached to it that can be a work or school account, or an account Azure AD trusts. 
- You can also use a Microsoft account to use Azure since Azure AD trusts these accounts.

An Azure account is *any* identity that's part of Azure AD, or a directory trusted by Azure AD.
- Note: if you sign up for an Azure account using a work or school account, any subscription will be created in the Azure AD your work or school account is part of.
  - When using a Microsoft account (or a personal account), Azure automatically generates an Azure AD tenant during the creation of your Azure account.
 
When you create an Azure account, you become the Account Administrator. By default, the account admin will have access to the new subscription. 
- In order to grant others access, you will need to use role based access control (RBAC).
- Note: Microsoft recommends using RBAC to grant access to users and any external users to Azure resources as classic roles are not being used anymore.

Multiple subscriptions can exist within the same Azure account. Some examples of reasons you'd want multiple subscriptions include, but are not limited to:
- Project isolation
- Environment isolation

There are several methods in which you can create an Azure subscription. Some of the following options may not be available for you as specific eligibility depends on terms & conditions of each offer:
- Enterprise Agreements (EAs)
- Web Direct
- Partners
- Resellers

To see other offers supported by Azure, see [Offer details](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/support/legal/offer-details/). 

Important:
- Invoices can be viewed on a monthly basis



### Cost management

Cloud governance includes managing your cloud cost. There are tools that can help you breakdown and track your costs. 

Azure Cost Management is a tool you can use to complete administrative billing tasks, including but not limited to: 
- Complete billing administrative tasks
- Create budgets and set alerts upon specific thresholds being passed
- Predict future costs using analytics
- Export data to Power BI dashboards using the Azure Cost Management connector
  - Note: this is only available to EA/MCA customers.
- Calculate potential savings and track reservation usage
- Schedule usage reports to be exported to a storage account for auditing
- Ingest AWS costs & analyze them within Azure

Azure Cost Management can be accessed from the Azure portal and will display charts that help explain your cloud spending. 

Remember:
- Costs are **resource-specific**
- Usage costs may vary between locations
- Costs for inbound & outbound data transfer differ
- We can pre-pay using **Azure reserved instances** to reduce our costs.
- We can use on-prem licenses with Azure Hybrid Benefit.
- Using tags, we can view spending trends to ensure we don't exceed budgets.
- Azure Advisor can be used to view cost optimization recommendations, helping us reduce trends.
- We can scale activities to help reduce the spend for our budgets.



### Manage resource groups

A resource group is a container used for the logical organization of Azure resources. These make deploying, deleting, and/or updating resources in bulk an easy task, saving you time from having to manually apply any changes to the resources.
- Note: it's advised to use caution before deleting resource groups as you are unable to undo this action.

Resources can be part of the same solution or grouped together however you prefer. Resources groups can also include resources from different regions, but this means the metadata will be stored in the same region as the resource group is located in, as resource groups contain the metadata about any resources making up the group.  
- Note: grouping resources together for the same solution, or by the same type of resources, can help make managing them easier.

Important: 
- Resource groups **cannot** be renamed.
- Resource groups **cannot** be nested.



### Management groups

Management groups provide the ability to logically group Azure subscriptions together, offering a new scope above the subscriptions to be used to: 
- Grant access
- Assign policies
- Analyze costs

Cost management can be scoped at this level for tracking the costs of multiple subscriptions under one view. This includes creating budgets, which is particularily helpful for teams working on multiple projects under different subscriptions.

Remember: 
- These groups provide organizational alignment for Azure subscriptions through *custom hierarchies* and *grouping*.
- We are enabled to target policies & budgets across subscriptions and inheritance down the hierarchies.
- By using optional management groups, we can support compliance & cost reporting.

With your tenant, there will be a **default** management group that is referred to as the *root management group*. Creating new management groups can be performed from the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI, and these new groups will be created as *children* of the default management group.
- Note: the root management group **cannot** be changed, but it is *optional* to use.

Members of each management group will be the subscription, or multiple subscriptions which can be **nested** between management groups.

There are two required parameters when you create a new management group:
- Management Group ID: used to specify the management group when running commands against it.
  - Note: this cannot be changed after creating the management group.
- Display name: used to point to the management group when using PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API calls.



### Azure policy

This service allows you to create, assign, and manage policies with different rules, over different resources and scopes. Rules can be enforced to ensure the org meets any compliance controls necessary. 

Azure policy will run evaluations constantly to resources are compliant and can make sure new resources are stopped before breaking any compliance requirements. 
- Note: Azure policy cannot delete resources that are reported as noncompliant, however, we can resolve any that are noncompliant.

Azure policy features include:
- Applying policies at scale
    - Policies can be applied to the management group level to be inherited by all subscriptions that are part of the group.
- Compliance and enforcement
    - Built-in or custom policies can be used to ensure compliance. Resources that don't meet compliance with your policies won't be deployed.
- Mitigation and remediation:
    - Remediation can be automated or performed manually.

Azure policy can help with the following scenarios:
- Prevent users from deploying expensive services (Cosmos DB, ExpressRoute, etc.)
- Require specific tags during resource deployment
- Require Azure Backup service is enabled on *all* VMs
- Limit VM deployment to only contain a specific set of SKUs, which helps prevent expensive VM SKUs from being deployed.
- Require resources to be deployed in specific regions, which helps the org meet any data residency requirements.

Remember, Azure policy helps with the following:
- Managing policy definitions and initiatives at different levels of scope.
- Enforcing tags to ensure the policy is followed upon resource creation.
- Requiring resources to be provisioned with a naming convention that is predetermined.
- Restricting resource creation to a list of specified types.

To configure Azure Policies:
- Search for Policy from the Azure portal
- Select the Definitions pane from the Authoring section
- Click + Policy definition
- To set the Definition location, click the blue ellipsis box
- Provide a name, description, & category
- For Policy rules, create the policy using JSON
- Assign the policy to the resource using the assign option on the police service panel

Note: we can group various policies in a container. 
- We can save existing policies to create new policy definitions that are assigned to new resources, using a new name.
  - The JSON can be used as a template to create a custom policy.
  - Tag Names will be a parameter in the policy, which require a display name before the policy can be created.



### Azure policy definition

To define policies: Azure portal > Policy > Definitions
- Note: add a filter to view built-in policies.
  - Using built-in policies will help reduce the time needed to write new policies.

The definition describes the action the policy will take when assigned. It's importation to note that this is in JSON format. 

The following information is required while defining the policy:
- Definition location
    - This is either the subscription or management group.
    - Note: policies that are defined at the subscription level cannot be assigned to management groups.
- Name
    - This will be the name that displays in the policy list. 
- Description
    - These will help others understand what the policy is for. 
- Category
    - These are helpful to filter policies.
- Policy rule
    - We have two options: Import from GitHub or write in the Azure portal using the editor.

Policies will contain a condition and effect.
- Condition: what is evaluated to confirm if the effect is applied or not.
- Effect: if the condition is matched, this is the action that is taken.


### Azure policy assignment & scope

Policy assignment is the process of assigning a definition to a specific scope. Once the assign page is selected, we can select the scope for the policy from the available scopes listed. 
- Note: it takes ~30mins for the evaluation report to be generated after assignment.
    - To assign custom policies to the management group, use the management group scope.
 
While assigning policies, the following information can be added on the Basics tab:
- Scope
    - This is where you would like the policy to apply.
- Exclusions
    - If any resources should be excluded, you would define those here.
    - Note: resources that are excluded will not be reported if they are noncompliant.
- Assignment name
    - This will be the name of the policy by default, however, it can be changed. 
- Description
    - This will help others understand the reason for the assignment.
- Policy enforcement
    - Disabled or enabled.
- Assigned by
    - By default, this will be the user that's currently assigning the policy.

Policy scope is the process that determines which subscriptions, resource groups, and resources are enforced by the policy. Management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups are included in supported scopes.


### Azure policy evaluation

A dashboard is provided to view the overall compliance of selected scopes, allowing you to remediate noncompliance. To view this dashboard: Policy > Overview > Compliance



### Resource locks

There are two types of resource locks:
- Delete: Authorized users can read and modify a resource, but are unable to delete the resource.
- Read-only: Authorized users can read a resource but cannot delete or update the resource.

To delete a locked VM, users will be required to contact an Owner or a User Access Admin.

Note: if the resource lock is on at the resource group level, all resources within the resource group inherit the lock.


### Apply & manage tags on resources

Resource tags are a way to understand costs spanning across different departments and Azure scopes. These tags will provide metadata for the Azure resourcs and *name value pairs*. 

Tags can be added in multiple ways:
- Azure portal
- CLI
- PowerShell
- ARM Templates
- REST API

Limitations: 
- There is a limit of 50 tag name value pairs for each resource, resource group, or subscription.
- Names **cannot** include special characters such as ```<, >, %, &, \, /, or ?```
- Tag names are limited to no more than 512 characters and values are limited to no more than 256 characters.
  - Important: storage account tag names are limited to no more than 124 characters.'
 
Note: tag values **can** be JSON strings, which can contain many values that apply to a single name.
- These would be managed for ARM templates.

To understand trends, you can use cost management which allows you to view the aggregation of tags applied.

Additionally, tags can manage Azure Policy.

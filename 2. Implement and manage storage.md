- Configure identity-based access for Azure Files


### Azure Storage

Azure Storage allows you to store files, messages, tables, and additional types of information in a durable, secure, scalable, managed, and accessible way. 

Azure Storage allows us to store:
- Disks and files for VMs
    - HDDs (lowest cost) or SSDs (through Premium storage)
- Unstructured data
    - Blobs (binary large object files), these are highly scalable REST-based cloud object stores
    - Data lake storage, Hadoop for example, allow us to manage file systems as a service
- Structured data
    - Tables - key value, autoscaling NoSQL stores
    - Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service
    - Azure SQL DB
    - Additional options for relational data
        - Important: structured data is nonrelational

Azure Storage Services:
Azure Containers
- Allow us to store & manage scalable object store for unstructured text and binary data
    - Important: Blobs **cannot** be mounted.
    - We can create an unlimited number of blobs.

Azure Files
- Allow us to store & manage file shares for cloud **or** on-prem deployments
  - Directories

Azure Tables
- Allow us to use NoSQL store for schema-less storage of structured data
    - Entities
 
Azure Queues
- Allow us to manage reliable communications between application components
    - Messaging

**Important: every object stored in Azure Storage has it's own, unique URL.** 
- The storage account name will form the *subdomain* of the URL
- The subdomain & domain forms **an endpoint**; examples of each endpoint:
    - Containers: ```http://storageacctname.blob.core.windows.net```
    - Files: ```http://storageacctname.file.core.windows.net```
    - Tables: ```http://storageacctname.table.core.windows.net```
    - Queues: ```http://storageacctname.queue.core.windows.net```

Note: custom domains can be configured
    - We can purchase a domain name from a registrar.
    - Once the domain name is purchased, we will need to validate it before adding it can be used with any services.
        - Verify the domain with either a TXT record, or MX record.
    - After verifying, we can map the CNAME record to our *target* to change the endpoint to display the custom domain instead of the storage account name.


### Shared Access Signature (SAS) Tokens

These tokens provide secure and delegated access to resources in our Azure Storage account.
- Provides access to clients without requiring sharing the storage account keys.
- Provides access to Azure resources in **multiple** storage accounts.
- Delegates secured access to a resource in **only one** of the storage services.

Best practices:
- Expiry date/time
- Time zone: to align the access required for users to their time zone
- Limit the distribution of SAS tokens
- Using HTTPS instead of HTTP
- Tokens should last only for the specific time needed to follow the principle of least privilege


### Stored Access Policies

Configuring stored access policies allows us to to have an additional level of control  over *service level* SAS on the server side.

Stages of configuring stored access policies:

Create or modify stored access policy
- We can set a max of 5 access policies on a container, table, queue, or shared at any given time.
- The change, or update, of a stored access policy can take up to 30 seconds to apply before it's active.
  - Note: the SAS associated with the policy may display a 403 (Forbidden) error code.

Revoke or modify stored access policy
- To revoke, we can delete or rename the policy.
  - This can be done by modifying the signed identifier OR by changing the expiry date/time with a value in the past.


### Storage Security

The security capabilities of Azure Storage work together to allow developers to build secure apps. 

Authorization options include:
- Azure AD: Cloud-based identity & access management option which gives control over resources.
- Shared Access Signatures: allow us to delete access to a specific resource for a predetermined amount of time with specific permissions. 
- Shared keys: provides authorization & relies on access keys, along with additional params, to provide encrypted signature strings that are passed in request headers.
- Anonymous access to containers & blobs: only use when information is **not** considered sensitive (PII).

 

## Configure and manage storage accounts

- Create and configure storage accounts
- Configure Azure Storage redundancy
- Configure object replication
- Configure storage account encryption
- Manage data by using Azure Storage Explorer and AzCopy


### Storage Redundancy

Azure Storage **always** stores multiple copies of data to ensure it's protected from planned and unplanned events, such as:
- Network outages
- Power outages
- Transient hardware failures
- Natural disasters

Azure Storage Redundnacy provides the ability to choose the redundancy options that meet our availability and durability needs.

Important: the redundancy settings for a storage account is shared for **all** storage services exposed by the storage account. 
- **All** storage resources deployed in the same storage account will have the **same** redundancy setting.

Redundancy in Primary region: data is replicated **three** times in the primary region

**Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)**
- Copies data synchronously three times within a single **physical** location (datacenter) in the **primary** region
  - Write requests occur synchronously
     - Write operation is successful **after** the data is written three times
- Protects against server rack & drive failures
  - Does **not** protect against datacenter fires or floods
      - Important: all data replicated using LRS may be unrecoverable if affected by fire/flood
      - **Microsoft recommends ZRS, GRS, or GZRS to mitigate this risk**
- Not recommended for apps needing high availability or durability
- Provides at least 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability of objects over a given year
- Lowest-cost & durability replication option

LRS might be the right choice for:
- Apps that stores data which can be reconstructed easily if data loss occurs
- Apps are restricted to replicating data within a country/region due to data governance requirements
  - **Important: some paired regions will replicate data to another country/region (geo-replication)**
- Apps using unmanaged disks
  - Unmanaged disks *can* use GRS, however, it isn't recommended due to potential issues


**Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)**
- Copies data synchronously **across three Azure availability zones** in the **primary** region
  - Each Availability Zone is a separate **physical** location with its own independent power, networking, and cooling
    - Write requests occur synchronously
      - Write operation is successful **after** the data is written across **all three** availability zones
        - Note: if a zone is temporarily unavailable, the operation will return successfully after the data is written to **all** availability zones
- Microsoft recommends ZRS for apps that require high availability, while also replicating to a secondary region
  - Recommended to use **ZRS in the primary region for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 workloads**
  - Recommended for **restricting the replication of data to a specific country/region** to meet any data governance requirements
      - Recommended to use for **Azure Files workloads** - if a zone becomes unavailable, remounting the file shares is **not** required
- Provides at least 99.9999999999% (12 nines) durability over a given year
- Data is accessible (read and write) even if a zone becomes unavailable
  - Azure will undertake networking updates, like DNS repointing, if a zone becomes unavailable
- Provides excellent performance, low latency, and resiliency for data if it's temporarily unavailable
  - Does **not** protect against regional disaster where multiple zones are permanently impacted.
    - Important: Microsoft recommends using GZRS to mitigate against this risk as it uses ZRS in the **primary** region while also geo-replicating data to a **secondary region**

It's best to follow practices for transient fault handling, such as implementing retry policies with exponential back-off, when designing apps using ZRS.

**Important: Archive tier for Blob Storage is not currently supported for ZRS, GZRS, or RA-GZRS**
  - Unmanaged disks do **not** support ZRS or GZRS

 
Redundnacy in Secondary region: data is copied to a secondary region, making the data durable even in the event of a **complete regional outage** or diaster that makes the primary region unrecoverable

**Geo-redundant Storage (GRS)**
- Copies data **synchronously three** times within a single, physical location in the **primary region** using LRS
  - Then, data is copied **asynchronously** to a single, physical location in the secondary region where the data will be copied **synchronously three times** using LRS


**Geo-zone-redundant Storage (GZRS)**
- Copies data **synchronously across three Azure Availability Zones** in the **primary region** using ZRS
  - Then, data is copied **asynchronously** to a single, physical location in the secondary region where the data will be copied **synchronously three times** using LRS


Important: the main difference between GRS and GZRS is how data is replicated within the **primary** region.
- Data is **always** replicated synchronously three times using LRS within the secondary region.
  - Replication using LRS in the secondary region protects data against **hardware failures**.

Important: with GRS and GZRS, data within the secondary region is **not** available for **read or write access** UNLESS there is a **failover to the primary region**.
- To gain read access to the secondary region, configure the storage account to use Read-Access Geo-redundant Storage (RA-GRS) or Read-Access Geo-zone-redundant Storage (RA-GZRS).
- If the primary region becomes unavailable, there is the option to choose to fail over to the secondary region.
  - Once the failover completes, the secondary region will become the primary region, restoring the ability to read and write data: [read more about disaster recovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-disaster-recovery-guidance). 

Important: since data is replicated to the secondary region **asynchronously**, failure that affects the primary region may result in **data loss** if the region cannot be recovered. 
- The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the interval between the most recent writes to the primary region and the last write to the secondary region.
  - RPO indicates the point in time to which data can be recovered.
  - Azure Storage usually has an RPO of less than 15mins, however, there is **not** an SLA currently for how long it takes to replicate data to the secondary region.


### Storage encryption 

Azure Storage Encryption is enabled by default on **all** storage accounts.
- This includes Resource Manager & Classic Storage Accounts.

Benefits of Storage Service Encryption (SSE):
- Automatically encrypts & decrypts data using 256-bit AES encryption
- Protects data for security & compliance
- Enabled for **all** storage accounts, whether new or exisiting
- Options for managing encryption keys
    - Microsoft Managed Keys: Microsoft rotates the keys on behalf of the customer.
    - Customer Managed Keys: bring your own keys and store them in an Azure Key vault, which is a key management system (PaaS).

### Immutable Storage - Blob Storage

Immutable storage for Blob Storage allows users to store business-critical data in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state.
- While in this state, data cannot be modified or deleted for a user specified time.
  - Important: Immutability policies protects your data from overwrites and deletes.
 
There are two types of immutability policies:
- Time-based retention policies: policies are set to store data for a specific timeframe.
  - Data can be created and read, but cannot be edited or deleted.
  - When the retention period expires, objects can be deleted but **cannot** be overwritten.
- Legal hold policies: these store the data until the legal hold is explicitly cleared.

Note: there is **no** additional cost for using immutable storage as the data is priced the same as mutable data.
